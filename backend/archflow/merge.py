"""Branch merge: a field-level three-way merge of one branch (*theirs*, the source) into another (*ours*, the target).

The merge base is the newest version both branches descend from. Versions form a graph through ``versions.parent``
(the previous version on the branch, or the version the branch was created from) plus the merge points recorded
here: applying a merge saves a version on the target whose message is ``Merged <source> (vN) into <target>``, and
vN counts as a second parent, so the next merge of the same branches starts from there. Without a common ancestor
the base is the version the source branch was created from (and an empty project if it has none).

Per component, connection and requirement, and per field:
- changed on one side only → that side's value is taken (auto-merged);
- changed on both sides to the same value → no conflict;
- changed on both sides differently → a **conflict** (``props`` is merged key by key, so two people editing
  different properties do not conflict);
- list fields (requirement links, actors, acceptance criteria) merge as sets and never conflict;
- ``position`` never conflicts: if both sides moved a component, the target's layout wins;
- deleted on one side and modified on the other → a **conflict** (keep it, or delete it);
- a requirement both sides added under the same id with different titles is renumbered, not merged.

After conflicts are resolved (``ours`` / ``theirs`` / ``custom`` value), the result is made consistent: elements
inside a removed component, and connections whose ends were removed or now sit in different diagrams, are dropped
and reported. The merged state is then turned into ordinary ops (:func:`plan_ops`) and applied by ``ops.apply_ops``
through the API's ``commit_ops``, so it is validated, logged, attributed and pushed to the live document like any
other change. A safety version of the target is saved first, as restore and adopt do.

Optional AI help: the ``merge.resolve`` agent proposes a resolution per conflict, with a rationale; the person still
picks. With no AI configured there is no suggestion.
